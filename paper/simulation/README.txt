The simulation in this particular folder refers to the paper 
"Using Joint Variable Importance Plots to Prioritize Variables 
in Assessing the Impact of Glyburide on Adverse Birth Outcomes"
that can be found on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09754

This is a separate section from the jointVIP code introduction
paper in the simulation folder.
This code is a gentle walk through of how one might use the
jointVIP and how it reduces the point estimate and its variance.
In the setting of small treated group with a constant effect.
