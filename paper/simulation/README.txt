The simulation in this particular folder refers to the paper
"Prioritizing Variables for Observational Study Design using
the Joint Variable Importance Plot"
that can be found on arXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09754
The paper is published in The American Statistician:
Liao et al., (2024) <doi:10.1080/00031305.2024.2303419>.

This is a separate section from the jointVIP code introduction
paper in the simulation folder.
This code is a gentle walk through of how one might use the
jointVIP and how it reduces the point estimate and its variance.
In the setting of small treated group with a constant effect.
