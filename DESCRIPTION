Description: In the observational study design stage, matching/weighting methods are
    conducted. However, when many background variables are present, the decision as to 
    which variables to prioritize for matching/weighting is not trivial. Thus, the 
    joint treatment-outcome variable importance plots are created to guide variable
    selection. The joint variable importance plots enhance variable comparisons via bias
    curves, derived using the classical omitted variable bias framework. The joint
    variable importance plots translate variable importance into recommended values for
    tuning parameters in existing methods. Post-matching and/or weighting plots can also
    be used to visualize and assess the quality of the observational study design. The
    package and its usage is showcased in "Using Joint Variable Importance Plots to 
    Prioritize Variables in Assessing the Impact of Glyburide on Adverse Birth Outcomes"
