Description: In the observational study design stage, matching/weighting methods are
    conducted. However, when many background variables are present, the decision as to 
    which variables to prioritize for matching/weighting is not trivial. Thus, the 
    joint treatment-outcome variable importance plots (jointVIP for short) are created 
    to guide variable selection. The jointVIPs enhance variable comparisons via bias curves,
    derived using the classical omitted variable bias framework, and jointVIPs can translate variable
    importance into recommended values for tuning parameters in existing methods. Post-matching/
    weighting plots can also be used to visualize and assess the quality of the observational
    study design.
