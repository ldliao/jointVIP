Description: In the observational study design stage, matching/weighting methods are
    conducted. However, when many background variables are present, the decision as to 
    which variables to prioritize for matching/weighting is not trivial. Thus, the 
    joint treatment-outcome variable importance plots are created to guide variable
    selection. The joint variable importance plots enhance variable comparisons via
    unadjusted bias curves derived under the omitted variable bias framework. The 
    plots translate variable importance into recommended values for tuning parameters 
    in existing methods. Post-matching and/or weighting plots can also be used to 
    visualize and assess the quality of the observational study design. The method
